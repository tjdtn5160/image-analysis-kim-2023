Analysis and plotting code used for Kim et al.2023.
Included are scripts for the timelapse and fixed cell image analysis pipeline used to process imaging experiments.
This pipeline has the following functionality:
 1. Tracking cells from time-lapse microscopy and quantification of fluorescent reporters (Kinase Translocation Reporter signal measured by nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear signal).
 2. Quantitative fluorescence analysis of fixed cell microscopy.

Pipeline was written based on code from https://github.com/MeyerLab/image-analysis-ratnayeke-2021 or https://github.com/scappell/Cell_tracking.
